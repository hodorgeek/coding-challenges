# carrom-clean-strike-game
A Carrom - clean strike game

## Problem Statement

A new game in carrom-board called Clean Strike is played by 2 players with multiple turns. A
turn has a player attempting to strike a coin with the striker. Players alternate in taking turns.
The game is described as follows:
- There are 9 black coins, a red coin and a striker on the carrom-board
- <u>Strike</u> - When a player pockets a coin he/she wins a point
- <u>Multi-strike</u> - When a player pockets more than one coin he/she wins 2 points. All, but 2
coins, that were pocketed, get back on to the carrom-board
- <u>Red strike</u> - When a player pockets red coin he/she wins 3 points. If other coins are
pocketed along with red coin in the same turn, other coins get back on to the
carrom-board
- <u>Striker strike</u> - When a player pockets the striker he/she loses a point
- <u>Defunct coin</u> - When a coin is thrown out of the carrom-board, due to a strike, the player
loses 2 points, and the coin goes out of play
- When a player does not pocket a coin for 3 successive turns he/she loses a point
- When a player **fouls** 3 times (a foul is a turn where a player loses, at least, 1 point),
he/she loses an additional point
- A **game is won** by the first player to have won at least 5 points, in total, and, at least, 3
points more than the opponent
- When the coins are exhausted on the board, if the highest scorer is not leading by, at
least, 3 points or does not have a minimum of 5 points, the game is considered a draw
<p>Write a program that takes in the outcome of each turn as input and outputs the result of the
game as and when applicable along with necessary statistics that supports the result. Please
find sample input and output below:</p>

## Unit Tests
- To execute unit test(junit5) use: ```./gradlew test```

## Game Simulation Test:
- It has written as junit only `Game Simulation Test` - [see here](src/test/java/com/hodorgeek/carrom/CleanStrikeGameSimulationTest.java)
 
## Building and running application
 Please note: If you're on Windows, use `gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew` script
   
   To build application, execute:
   
   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```
  
### Fat jar

To generate fat/uber jar file with all dependencies, execute:

```
./gradlew shadowJar
```

Assuming you have executed command above, to run game as a standalone application, execute:

```
 java -jar build/libs/carrom-clean-strike-1.0.jar
```
The above command will start the game as command line menu driven application.
